The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:


Create a quiz. 
*The user will read each question and click on the answer they believe is correct. 

*There will be a timer that gives them a designated amount of time to complete the quiz. 

*When the user responds to each question, the browser will inform them if their response was correct or incorrect. 

*When the user selects an incorrect answer, the score decrements by 1, and two penalty seconds are taken off of the timer.  When the user selects a correct answer, the score increments by 1 and the quiz continues.

*There is a two-second interval between each question. 

*When the timer runs out of time, the quiz is over.  If the user finishes all of the questions before time runs out, the quiz is over.

*When the quiz is over, the userâ€™s name and score will be displayed, along with a high score button where a list of high scores are stored.
